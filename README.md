# Webpack Deep Diving
A personnal project aiming to understand as much as possible the module bundler that is webpack.
Webpack is a module bundler which means it processes plainty of files with various extensions 
and outputs them in x files ( according to what you could configure ) but definitively fewer 
than all you already have: cf "bundle"
- bundles files and assets
- manages dependencies.
